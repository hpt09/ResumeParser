 which are recommendations on banking laws and regulations issued by the Basel Committee on.,-1
 Banking Supervision.,-1
 The purpose of Basel II,-1

 create an international standard that banking regulators can use when creating regulations about.,-1
 how much capital banks need to put aside to guard against the types of financial and operational.,-1
 risks banks face.,-1
 In practice,-1
 Basel II attempts to accomplish this by setting up rigorous risk.,-1
 and capital management requirements designed to ensure that a bank holds capital reserves.,-1

 requirements for credit,-1
 market and operational risk.,-1
 For Risk Based Capital (RBC),-1
 Credit Usage.,-1
 (CU) and Stress Test (ST),-1
 the methodologies that will be used for repo style transactions are.,-1

 applications on a given network..     WAAS system consists of a set of devices called wide area application engines (WAEs) that work.,-1
 together to optimize TCP traffic over your network.,-1
 When client and server applications attempt.,-1
 to communicate with each other,-1
 the network intercepts and redirects this traffic to the WAEs so.,-1
 that they can act on behalf of the client application and the destination server..,-1
 The WAEs examine the traffic and use built-in application policies to determine whether to.,-1
 optimize the traffic or allow it to pass through your network un optimized.,-1

 BTRAMR0001SYSER.rptdesign (Work order report):.,-1
 My client was using default BTRAMR2 Work order reports.,-1
 They also use a different work order.,-1
 report in Maximo V4 and V6.,-1
 The earlier used report have many drawbacks such as.,-1
 No Flexibility for modification since it is used by many divisions.,-1
 Empty boxes,-1
 lot of missing information.,-1
 Not align with Systems objectives and processes.,-1
 Historical context on the asset is missing.,-1
 Esthetical issues: Font too small,2
 input fields not instinctive.,-1
 No bar coding used.,-1
 The outcome of this report is a form to support technician s work and regulation and give.,-1
 them simplicity to input information.,-1
 It covers the full spectra of requirements of System Services.,-1
 divisions..,-1
 This report is site specific one and it will display the WO details along with its task WOs and.,-1
 failure reporting information..     Each site is having their own logo.,-1
 This current report will display the logo based on site..,2
 It was implemented in V7.1 only.,-1
 In V7.1 we do not have the option of auto resetting page.,-1
 numbers (i.e.,-1
 while displaying multiple WOs,-1
 for each new WO page number will not be reset.,-1
 automatically) .,-1
 I have implemented this option in this report..,-1
 Language Translation was used for this report in German and French.,-1
 I did not use IBM templates for this report.,-1
 I have customized our own template in this report.. .,-1
 BTRAMR0009.rptdesign (Availability Report):.,-1
 This particular report relates to the requirement of the business to be able to create a.,-1
 Availability Graph based on selected Train Assets,-1
 a timeframe and selected work types / work.,-1
 order parameters..,-1
 Availability can be calculated based on a Fleet or a single Train.,-1
 The business requirement is to.,-1
 be able to select this base as needed to suit the project or view needed at that time.. .,2
 BTRAMR0027.rptdesign (Card Stock Report):.,-1
 Existing report functionality:.,-1
 Technician requiring a part will take the component in its bin along with an Inventory Card.,-1
 The.,-1
 technician reports the consumption at the exit of the storeroom on the Kiosk computer where.,-1
 he scans its Work Order and the Inventory Card in the application Issue and Transfer of Maximo..,-1
 When we rebuild something internally,-1
 the technician will bring the new assembly in store,-1
 grab.,-1
 the Inventory Card and he will report the return in store against the rebuilt Work order..,-1
 Objectives:.,-1
 Created a card stock report in order to match the existing Inventory Card tool developed by.,-1
 Systems..     Increase reporting of consumption.,-1
 Redefine the process of cycle count (80  efficiency in Systems).,-1
 The report will be based on inventory information and will introduce the notion of real time to.,-1
 increase precision.,-1
 BTRAMR0001SBB.rptdesign (Report Change):.,-1
 The report BTRAMR0001SBB was developed for the European project.,-1
 It is based on the.,-1
 BTRAMR0001MLM report and currently uses only launch option 2 and 3 of the BTRAMR0001MLM.,-1
 report.,-1
 The client requested to have option 1 (type 1) of the BTRAMR0001MLM implemented in.,-1
 the BTRAMR0001SBB report as well as the translation of the labels from French to English..,-1
 Objectives:.,-1
 To have define the type 1,-1
 report definition for BTRAMR0001SBB.,-1
 To have the labels translated from French to English.,-1
 BTRAMR0002.rptdesign (Systems Purchase Requisition Report):.,-1

 Description: Development of Basel II Application,-1
 Basel II is the second of the Basel Accords,-1
.,-1
 which are recommendations on banking laws and regulations issued by the Basel Committee on.,-1
 Banking Supervision.,-1
 The purpose of Basel II,-1

 is to.,-1
 create an international standard that banking regulators can use when creating regulations about.,-1
 how much capital banks need to put aside to guard against the types of financial and operational.,-1
 risks banks face.,-1
 In practice,-1
 Basel II attempts to accomplish this by setting up rigorous risk.,-1
 and capital management requirements designed to ensure that a bank holds capital reserves.,-1
 appropriate to the risk the bank exposes itself to through its lending and investment practices.. .,-1
 The New Accord includes several methodologies for determining a bank s risk-based capital.,-1
 requirements for credit,-1
 market and operational risk.,-1
 For Risk Based Capital (RBC),-1
 Credit Usage.,-1
 (CU) and Stress Test (ST),-1
 the methodologies that will be used for repo style transactions are.,-1

 GRADUATION PROJECT.,-1
 Project Title   Wireless Data Encryption And Decryption Using Rf Module  .,-1
 Brief Description of the Project We design and implement encoder and decoder by using RF.,-1
 module.,-1
 The source.,-1
 information is generated by a keypad and this will be encrypted and is sent to the.,-1
 destination through RF communication.,-1
 The receiving system will check the data.,-1
 and decrypt according to the specific algorithm and display on the LCD.,-1
 The RF.,-1
 module used here are Bluetooth of 9.6 kbps which has inbuilt RF encoder and RF.,-1
 decoder and AT89C52 micro control unit (MCU).,-1
 This encoder converts the 8bit.,-1
 data into a single bit and send it to the transmitter which will be transmitting.. POST GRADUATION PROJECT.,-1

 https://www.indeed.com/r/Aboli-Patil/643b8f3de04165ac isid rex-download ikw download-top co IN.,-1
 technique,-1
 where the information of a original cover is recovered using lossless.,-1
 approach,-1
 The data extraction is done once the extraction of embedded message is.,-1
 successfully recovered.,-1
 The applications of reversible data hiding are in medical.,-1
 imagery,-1
 military imagery and law forensics,-1
 where no distortion of the original.,-1
 content is allowed.,-1
 In the reversible data hiding method,-1
 First empty room.,-1
 is made by embedding LSBs of some pixels into other pixels with RDH method and.,-1
 then encrypt the image,-1
 so the positions of these LSBs in the encrypted image can.,-1
 be used to embed data .In the first phase,-1
 a content owner encrypts the original.,-1
 uncompressed image using an encryption key.,-1
 Then,-1
 a data-hider compress the.,-1
 least significant bits of the encrypted image using a data-hiding key to create a. sparse space to accommodate some additional data.,-1
 If the receiver has both key.,-1
 data-hiding key and the encryption key,-1
 it can extract the secret data and recover.,-1
 the original image.,-1
