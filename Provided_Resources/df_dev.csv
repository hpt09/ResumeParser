IP. is a packet-based protocol used to exchange data, voice, and video traffic over digital networks.     Cisco s Wide-Area Application Services IPv4 users can move to IPv6 and receive services such. as end-to-end security, quality of service (QoS), and globally unique addresses. The IPv6 address. space reduces the need for private addresses and Network Address Translation (NAT) processing. by border routers at network edges..     Implementing basic IPv6 connectivity in the Cisco IOS software consists of assigning IPv6. addresses to individual router interfaces. The forwarding of IPv6 traffic can be enabled globally,. and Cisco Express Forwarding switching for IPv6 can also be enabled.     The primary motivation for IPv6 is the need to meet the demand for globally unique IP. addresses..     Mainly involves to checks the functionality of all waas features to work with v6 addressing. .

Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) is a Cisco Systems technology that improves the. performance of applications on a wide area network (WAN). WAAS combines Cisco s Wide Area. File Services (WAFS-products allow remote office users to access and share files globally at. LAN speeds over the WAN) with WAN optimization inside of a router, accelerating TCP-based. applications on a given network..     WAAS system consists of a set of devices called wide area application engines (WAEs) that work. together to optimize TCP traffic over your network. When client and server applications attempt. . . . to communicate with each other, the network intercepts and redirects this traffic to the WAEs so. that they can act on behalf of the client application and the destination server..     The WAEs examine the traffic and use built-in application policies to determine whether to. optimize the traffic or allow it to pass through your network un optimized.
